Welcome to **multijoy.co.uk**. This has been kicking about the internet for a number of years and has, on occasion, had content. The current incarnation is an experiment in Jekyll, because frameworks make my head hurt. It is also an opportunity to work out how to use GitHub, no doubt just in time for all the cool kids to start using something else.

In order to justify the server, there will be some reviews of various bits and pieces.

If you want *actual* web development, speak to [Alex](http://greyhead.co.uk), who does this sort of thing for a living.
  

## The site
* Running on a [Dedibox SC 2016 from online.net](https://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-sc), which is a surprisingly capable dedicated server. Perhaps not as fast as a Linode VM, but cheap with a massive hard disk and stonkingly fast net connection (nudge nudge, wink wink).
* [Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS - Xenial Xerus](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) on top of which is running
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on top of [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html)
* which is then skinned with the [Moon theme](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)
* and finally, an icon by [freepik](http://freepik.com) from [flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com)
* The background is a picture of a field in darkest Dorset, just behind Larmer Tree. [White Star Running](http://www.whitestarrunning.co.uk/) do races around these parts, go, have a run.
